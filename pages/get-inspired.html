          The climate change movement is a global social and academic movement focussed on pressuring governments and
          industry leaders to take action to reduce the affects of climate change. The movement is comprised of a
          rapidly growing and diverse coalition of individuals and groups alike, passionate about inspiring changes to
          our behaviours and attitudes towards our planet.
