        The United Kingdom is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, anticipating an
        overall reduction of up to 80%. With a focus on moving away from expensive and unpredictable coal-fired power
        stations on a global market, and increasing off-shore wind, solar and nuclear energy, the UK has succeeded in
        reducing emissions between 1990 and 2021 by 73.4%.

        But we still have a long way to go. Domestic energy use accounts for up to 14% of our annual greenhouse gas
        emissions, and the use of gas boilers and inadequate insulation is to blame. Our homes are some of the least
        sufficient in Europe, and the government has pledged to create sustainable homes.

      <h2 class="subheading">How Can You Make a Change?</h2>

          Swapping your gas boiler for a heat pump is one of the best ways to reduce your household’s carbon emissions.
          Heat pumps can transform thermal energy from your property’s surrounding ground, air or water to provide
          energy
          to your heating systems. Air source heat pumps use as little as a third as much energy as a baseboard electric
          heater. While expensive to install, grants of up to £5000 are currently available to help homeowners make
          the switch and if opting for a ground source heat pump, you can expect to reduce your energy bills by at least
          26% in comparison to a new gas boiler.

          However, there are simpler ways to go about reducing your carbon emissions. Insulation is one of the most
          efficient ways to reduce greenhouse gases from the use of household heating systems. Ensuring that your
          property
          is adequately insulation reduces the need for heating systems to regulate the temperature of the home. Schemes
          to help lower-income households to afford the switch are in development. Insulating the ground floor can save
          up
          to £200 per year by limiting the amount of heat lost.
