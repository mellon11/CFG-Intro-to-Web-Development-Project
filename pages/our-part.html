        The United Kingdom is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, anticipating an
        overall reduction of up to 80%. With a focus on moving away from expensive and unpredictable coal-fired power
        stations on a global market, and increasing off-shore wind, solar and nuclear energy, the UK has succeeded in
        reducing emissions between 1990 and 2021 by 73.4%.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we still have a long way to go. Domestic energy use accounts for up to 14% of our annual greenhouse gas
        emissions, and the use of gas boilers and inadequate insulation is to blame. Our homes are some of the least
        sufficient in Europe, and the government has pledged to create sustainable homes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subheading">How Can You Make a Change?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          Swapping your gas boiler for a heat pump is one of the best ways to reduce your household’s carbon emissions.
          Heat pumps can transform thermal energy from your property’s surrounding ground, air or water to provide
          energy to your heating systems. Air source heat pumps use as little as a third as much energy as a baseboard
          electric heater, while the efficiency of a water source heat pump has the potential to reach up to 600%. While
          expensive to install, grants of up to £5000 are currently available to help homeowners make the switch.
          <br>
          <br>
          Heat pumps require far less maintenance than combustion heating systems, only requiring checks by a
          professional installer once every three to five years. A simple annual check of basis details of the system
          can be completed by yourself. Heat pumps are also much safer than traditional combustion-based heating
          systems, since they rely on electricity and do not need to burn fuel to generate heat. They come with far
          fewer safety warnings in comparison to gas boilers. As well as this, they are much cheaper to run. For
          example, if opting for a ground source heat pump, you can expect to reduce your energy bills by at least 26%
          in comparison to a new gas boiler.

          However, there are simpler ways to go about reducing your carbon emissions. Insulation is one of the most
          efficient ways to reduce greenhouse gases from the use of household heating systems. Around 25% of heat is
          lost through the roof of a poorly insulated home due to heat rising, and as a result roof and loft insulation
          is typically the most efficient and cheapest to install. However most homes built after 1920 have a cavity
          between the walls, which can be filled with an insulating material such as cellulose, fibreglass and mineral
          rock wool. Ensuring that your property is adequately insulated reduces the need for heating systems to
          regulate the temperature of the home. Insulating the ground floor can save up to £200 per year by limiting the
          amount of heat lost.
          <br>
          <br>
          Schemes to help lower-income households to afford the switch are in development. ECO+ (running from April 2023
          to March 2026) will provide loft and cavity wall insulation to eligible homes with a D or worse energy rating.
          This scheme is anticipated to help hundreds and thousands of households in Britain to save as much as £300 per
          year on their energy bills. To be eligible, your home must be within a lower council tax band as well as have
          an EPC rating of D or worse. However, there will be some help afforded to those who are considered most
          vulnerable including those on means-tested benefits or in fuel poverty. More details of the scheme are yet to
          be made public until it is unveiled by Business Secretary, Grant Shapps.
