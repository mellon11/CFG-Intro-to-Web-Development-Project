      <h2 class="subheading">What is climate change</h2>

      <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural,
        such
        as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of
        climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
        Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth,
        trapping
        the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
        Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These
        come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and
        forests
        can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy,
        industry,
        transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

      <h2 class="subheading">Fast Facts</h2>
      <p>
        Healthy ecosystems can provide 37 per cent of the mitigation needed to limit global temperature rise. Damaged
        ecosystems release carbon instead of storing it.
        Climate action is not a budget buster or economy-wrecker. Shifting to a green economy could yield a direct
        economic gain of $26 trillion through 2030 compared with business-as-usual. This could produce over 65 million
        new low-carbon jobs.
        A green transition, including a shift to renewable energy, the manufacturing of electric vehicles and
        construction of energy-efficient buildings, will create 24 million jobs by 2030, far more than the 6 million
        that could be lost.

    <div>
      <h2 class="subheading">Cause and Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Cutting down forests to create farms or pastures, or for other reasons, causes emissions, since trees, when they
        are cut, release the carbon they have been storing. Each year approximately 12 million hectares of forest are
        destroyed. Since forests absorb carbon dioxide, destroying them also limits nature’s ability to keep emissions
        out
        of the atmosphere. Deforestation, together with agriculture and other land use changes, is responsible for
        roughly
        a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global surface temperature. The last decade, 2011-2020, is
        the
        warmest on record. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one. Nearly all land areas are
        seeing more hot days and heat waves. Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and make working
        outdoors
        more difficult. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter. Temperatures in
        the Arctic have warmed at least twice as fast as the global average.
